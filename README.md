# The Problem

<img align="right" src="/images/facebook_data.png" width="350" />

Throughout our early adult lives, we have used Facebook events as an easy way to invite friends to personal events like house warmings and birthday parties. We love that the app keeps track of RSVPs, so we can avoid making yet another spreadsheet.

However, over the years we noticed that more and more of our peers and no longer using the platform. While most of our friends still have Facebook profiles, they are not engaging with the platform as often as they used to.

Data supports this - research has shown (see graph) that young people are increasingly using YouTube, Snapchat, and Instagram rather than Facebook.

If our desired attendees are not checking their Facebooks, how can we invite them to an event and track their responses?

# The Solution

We set out to build an easy to use RSVP form creator for users to invite friends to their events and keep track of RSVPs. Rather than sending an invitation to hand picked list of Facebook friends, RSVP links, or evites, would need to be distributed by the users themselves over email or text - whatever way they could most easily reach their desired attendees.

Users would first register their email address and created a password that would be encrypted and stored in the database. After registering, they would login and be directed to the Create an event form.

Following the Facebook model, users would enter all necessary details of their upcoming event including time, date, location and description. All of this information would be populated into their evite.

After clicking submit, the user would be directed to the Dashboard. As the central home of the app, the Dashboard includes all of their events, evites, and quick snapshots of the RSVPs.

Clicking on Event details would show all of the details submitted in the Create an event form and provide a list of all of the RSVPs, including their names and email addresses.
