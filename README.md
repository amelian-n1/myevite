# The Problem

<img align="right" src="/images/facebook_data.png" width="350" />

Throughout college and our early adult lives, we have used Facebook events as an easy way invite friends to personal events like house warmings and birthday parties. We love that the app keeps track of RSVPs, so we can avoid making yet another spreadsheet.

However, over the years we have noticed that more and more of our peers and no longer using the platform. While most of our friends still have Facebook profiles, they are not engaging with the platform as often as they used to.

Data supports this - research shows that young people are increasingly using YouTube, Snapchat, and Instagram rather than Facebook.

If our desired attendees are not checking their Facebooks, how can we easily invite them to an event and track their responses?
