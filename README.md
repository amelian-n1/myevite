# The Problem

<img align="right" src="/images/facebook_data.png" width="350" />

For years we have utilized Facebook events as an easy way to keep track of RSVPs without a creating a spreadsheet.

However, over the years we have noticed that more and more of our peers and no longer using the platform. While most of our friends still have Facebook profiles, they are not engaging with the platform as often as they used to.

Data supports this - research shows that young people are increasingly using YouTube, Snapchat, and Instagram rather than Facebook.

If our desired attendees are not checking their Facebooks, how can we easily invite them to an event and track their responses?
